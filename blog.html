                <h2>
                    Joao Sousa, Senior Programme Officer at the International Union for Conservation of Nature, spoke to
                    International Editor Clifford Holt about the problem of marine plastic pollution and some of the
                    potential solutions.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), every year over 300 million
                    tonnes of plastic are produced, half of which is used to design single-use items such as shopping
                    bags, cups, and straws. At least eight million tonnes of plastic end up in the oceans every year and
                    make up 80% of all marine debris from surface waters to deep-sea sediments.

                    <br /><br />

                    Plastic pollution has a significant social, economic and ecological impact. Marine plastics threaten
                    ocean health, human health, food safety and coastal tourism as well as contributing to climate
                    change.

                    <br /><br />

                    To better understand the extent of plastic pollution, the IUCN has produced several analytical
                    pieces of work and is supporting various policy and programmatic actions. The innovation Platform’s
                    International Editor, Clifford Holt, spoke with Joao Sousa, Senior Programme Officer on Marine
                    Plastics at the IUCN’s Global Marine and Polar Programme, about some of the ways that marine plastic
                    pollution could be tackled.

                <h1>Plastic pollution</h1>
                <p>Plastic pollution is the accumulation of plastic objects and particles in the Earth's environment
                    that adversely affects wildlife, wildlife habitat, and humans. Plastics that act as pollutants are
                    categorized by size into micro-, meso-, or macro debris. <span><a

            <div class="text">
                <p class="headtext">What would you say are the biggest challenges when it comes to tackling plastic
                    pollution? Have there been any specific developments in this fight that you feel have potential to
                    make some headway?</p>
                <p class="sidetext">Regarding plastic pollution, an important point to make is that plastic is not one
                    material but a family of materials, and as such there is not only one solution. Indeed, plastic is a
                    family of polymers which can create a multitude of problems, meaning that diverse solutions need to
                    be developed. What is more, any potential solution depends on the specific polymer type, and that
                    also needs to take into account how it is used, how it is disposed of, and so on. It therefore
                    becomes clear that even here, for one type of plastic, many problems can emerge. Nevertheless, many
                    of the problems relate to single use plastics in a general sense because those are the ones with a
                    very short life-span.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="b3">
        <p>It is thus necessary to understand that the issues around plastics and plastic pollution are more complex
            than they may first seem, and then, of course, that we need to ensure that these issues place high on the
            political agenda. That is, while plastics are being highlighted in terms of pollution in a general sense,
            when it comes to the challenges facing the oceans, the issue of plastics is just one of several important
            problems – including deoxygenation, acidification, melting ice caps, and so on. These problems all need to
            be addressed, and often plastic pollution is seen as being less of a priority.

            <br /><br />

            A second significant challenge concerns groups who do not want to see a change and who have a very strong
            voice in this area. Their capacity to hinder promising legislation, for example, should not be taken
            lightly. Third, there is a lack of enforcement of existing legislation. The answer is not necessarily for
            all governments to follow the same path as some countries, for instance, by banning certain plastic products
            and introducing a large fine for breaching the ban. However, relying on voluntary measures alone is never
            going to be enough; history has shown us that if people are merely asked to stop, then many will continue
            until more forceful measures are introduced.

            <br /><br />

            I am an advocate for the ‘polluter cleans’ principle, whereby the polluter is required to fully clean up, no
            matter the financial cost of the operation. Bankruptcy in other areas has been used as a way to get out of
            paying for remediation as it is not high on creditors’ list of priorities. Only by making organisations
            responsible for cleaning up after their own activities will we be able to affect change.
    </div>

    <div class="b4">
        <p>
            The United Nations Environmental Programme has identified that it is possible to estimate the financial
            impact of plastic pollution in the oceans. However, there is a real need for more granular data, knowledge
            about local impacts in local economies, concrete data, and for a tool that I can use to address the Minister
            of Economy in any given country to demonstrate how much money their country has lost because they have
            mismanaged plastics. We want to be able to put this into real terms, and to be able to tell them, for
            instance, that if they had managed plastics properly then they would have saved enough money to build a
            certain number of hospitals, or to show them the impacts of the mismanagement in terms of the impacts on
            sectors such as tourism and fisheries, as well as in terms of the loss of biodiversity, because all of these
            things can be quantified.

            <br /><br />

            We are currently conducting a project to develop such a tool, which involves taking a snapshot of the entire
            amount of plastic waste that is generated by a country, as well as the associated leakage, over time. This
            will enable us to demonstrate how that waste is converted into lost money for the economy and, moreover,
            what that money could have meant to the country – it is often not enough to highlight this in terms of money
            per se, but when it is explained in terms of the amount of new schools or hospitals which could have been
            built, people tend to take more notice.

        <h1>Top 10 countries doing the most to <br /> tackle plastic pollution</h1>

        <div class="map">
            <p>

                Plastic takes between 500 and 1,000 years to completely degrade. As a result, ALL of the plastic that
                has ever been manufactured or used by us can still be found in some form on our planet. Think of it this
                way: every toothbrush you have ever used is still out there – somewhere.

                <br /><br />

                A shocking 40 per cent of plastic is used only once before being discarded. And only nine per cent of
                plastic has EVER been recycled. It’s no wonder then that we have now reached a crisis point.

                <br /><br />

                Of the 300 million tonnes of plastic waste the world produces every year (the same as the weight of the
                entire world population), eight million tonnes end up in the oceans, killing marine life and entering
                the human food chain. Plastic also accelerates climate change by emitting greenhouse gases at every
                stage of its lifecycle.

        <p>
            In the UK, the government says it “aims to eliminate avoidable plastic waste by the end of 2042.” But around
            the world, countries are taking far more drastic measures to hold back the rising tide of plastic pollution.

                    In May 2021, Canada declared plastic a “toxic” substance, paving the way for its proposed ban on
                    most single-use plastics by the end of the year. This would be the most ambitious move yet by any
                    country in the war against plastic.

                    <br /><br />

                    Canada, which has the world’s longest coastline at 151,019 miles and a quarter of the world’s fresh
                    water, currently recycles only around nine percent of its disposable plastics. Without a drastic
                    change, it would be on track to throw away $11 billion (£8.6 billion) worth of disposable plastic by
                    2030.

                    Rwanda became the world’s first ‘plastic-free’ nation in 2009, 10 years after it introduced a ban on
                    all plastic bags and plastic packaging. Anyone who is caught with a plastic item faces a jail
                    sentence of up to six months.

                    <br /><br />

                    On entering a border post into the country, vehicles are searched and any plastic bags or packaging
                    are confiscated before they enter the country.

                    India shocked the world in 2017 when it announced it would eliminate all single-use plastic by 2022.

                    <br /><br />

                    With a population of 1.35 billion people, the world’s fastest-growing country is responsible for
                    500,000 tonnes of mismanaged plastic waste reaching the ocean every year. Around eighty percent of
                    plastic in India is discarded as waste, and more than forty percent of this
                    goes uncollected.

                    <br /><br />

                    The proposed first phase of the ban, set to
                    begin on 30 September 2021, will target thin plastic carrier bags (the hardest to recycle).
                    On 1 January 2022, six categories of single-
                    use plastic – including earbuds with plastic
                    sticks, plastic sticks for balloons, plastic flags, candy sticks, ice-cream sticks and polystyrene
                    (PS) for decoration – are to be banned.

            <p class="outertext">
                And a third and final stage, to take effect on 1 July 2022, will see plastic plates, glasses, cutlery,
                plastic stirrers, packaging films on sweet boxes, invitation cards, cigarette packets, and thin plastic
                banners outlawed.

                <br /><br />

                The policy is, however, widely expected to be met with fierce opposition from plastics manufacturers
                across the country.

                    Set in August 2017, Kenya’s plastic bag ban is widely regarded as the strictest in the world. Anyone
                    found producing, selling – or even just carrying – a plastic bag faces up to four years’
                    imprisonment, or a fine of up to $40,000 (£31,000). The only exemption is for manufacturers who use
                    polythene to wrap products.

                    <br /><br />

                    The ban was set after Kenyans were found to be using 24 million plastic bags each month. The United
                    Nations’ Environment Programme discovered that cows slaughtered in Nairobi regularly had up to 20
                    bags in their stomachs, sparking fears over plastic contamination in the food chain.

            </div>
            <p class="outertext">
                The ban appears to be working with a dramatic decline in the number of bags littering Kenya’s shanty
                towns – particularly “flying toilets”, where residents defecate in a plastic bag, tie it up and then
                throw it on to the tin roofs.

                In June 2020, Kenya also banned the use of all single-use plastics in protected areas.

                    In Germany, a deposit return scheme was introduced in 2003 where customers pay a 25 cent (22 pence)
                    deposit on every bottle of soft or alcoholic drink. This excludes milk, baby products and medical
                    liquids.

                    <br /><br />

                    The move has seen almost 99 per cent of the country’s plastic bottles returned for recycling. Since
                    the introduction of the scheme, an estimated 1.2 billion containers have been diverted from
                    landfill.

                    <br /><br />

                    Glass bottles are also subject to the scheme and typically have a deposit of between eight and 15
                    cents (seven to 13 pence) added to their cost. Once they are collected, they are typically sent back
                    to manufacturers for cleaning and refilling.

                    2014.

                    <br /><br />

                    The Norwegian government has set up more than 3,500 reverse vending machines and 11,500 registered
                    collection points across the nation to encourage residents to recycle. Up to 92 per cent of the
                    bottles recycled hold material that is of such high quality it can be re-used again in drink bottles
                    sometimes more than 50 times.

                    plastic cups, cutlery, plates, and takeaway food boxes. The law requires all disposable tableware to
                    be made from 50 per cent bio-sourced materials that can be composted at home. This rises to 60 per
                    cent by 2025.

                    <br /><br />

                    The legislation was passed after statistics from the French Association of Health and Environment
                    revealed that only one per cent of the 4.73 billion single-use plastic cups thrown away each year in

                    billion plastic bags a year – the equivalent of each resident using more than 200 annually. The ban
                    has seen bags replaced with sustainable alternatives such as paper, cotton or sugarcane variants.
